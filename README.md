- Using D3 and Plotly to attempt to help visualize the data.


Once the data has been organized and called upon, we are able to visually see the data for the 5-year intervals. As predicted, California is typically amongst the highest states amongst the intervals. The surprising one was Rhode Island ranking amongst one of the highest.
